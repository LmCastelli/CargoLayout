## What's it do?

This project was made to assist my buddy when calculating cargo space when loading trucks for transport. 

This app takes in truck and cargo length, width, height, as well as whether or not the cargo can be stacked on top of itself. 

After calculating the max of two different layouts (how the cargo is input vs rotating 90 degrees) it creates the layout for the cargo using top/left CSS styling.

### Future additions 

Eventually I'd love to make this take multiple cargo sizes at once, as well as handling weight distrubution. 

Mobile viewing would also be nice, as of now it gets smooshed pretty good on mobile.
